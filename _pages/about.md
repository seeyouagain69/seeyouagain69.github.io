I am a first-year master's student from [School of Automation](https://automation.seu.edu.cn/), [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/). I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yangang Wang](https://www.yangangwang.com/) of Vision and Cognition Lab(VCL).

My research focuses on 3D human motion capture and human pose estimation.
